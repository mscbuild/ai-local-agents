# ðŸ§  AI Agent Projects with Ollama + LangChain (Fully autonomous and privacy-preserving)

This repository showcases my hands-on projects while learning about **AI Agents** using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com), and Python. It includes both minimal setups and advanced interactive applications that demonstrate real-world agent use cases like memory handling, voice interaction, and local LLM inference.

## ðŸŽ“ Projects Overview

### 1. `basic_ai_agent/` â€“ Basic LLM Agent

Minimal examples to:

* Load local LLMs (like `phi`, `mistral`, etc.) via Ollama
* Run single-turn and memory-supported agents
* Try a web UI version with Streamlit

### 2. `pdf_summary_bot/` â€“ PDF QA Agent

Ask questions or summarize based on uploaded PDF content:

* `app_basic_qa.py`: Basic question answering
* `app_summary_qa.py`: Summary-focused version

### 3. `voice_assistant/` â€“ Voice-Based LLM Chat

Talk to your LLM with:

* A terminal-based CLI voice chat
* A full Streamlit-based voice chat UI

### 4. `web_scraper_agent/` â€“ Web Scraping AI Agent

Give queries like "Find top Python tutorials" and get results scraped live:

* `ai_web_scraper.py`: Basic tool-based agent
* `ai_web_scrapper_faiss.py`: Uses memory and FAISS for smarter recall

   ```

3. **Make sure Ollama is running**

   ```bash
   ollama run phi
   ```

4. **Run a project**

   ```bash
   cd voice_assistant
   python ai_voice_assistant_and_streamlit_app.py
   # OR
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## ðŸ“œ Requirements

Each folder includes its own `requirements.txt`, but a master file is available at root if you want to install everything together.

* Python 3.9+
* Ollama running locally with a model like `phi`, `mistral`, or `llama2`
* Microphone + speaker (for voice apps)

## âœ¨ Credits

* [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for the powerful agent ecosystem
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for local, private LLM serving
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for interactive UIs
